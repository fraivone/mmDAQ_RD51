I. PREREQUISITES

1. Boost.org libraries from http://www.boost.org/ (maybe preinstalled on SLC)
   tested version 1.49 (the latest)
2. ROOT installed, in path and libraries-related environment variables set up


II. INSTALLATION

1. Check out from svn+ssh://username@svn.cern.ch/reps/mamma/eventbrowser/trunk

2. set up

2.1. for compilation
   a) check and correct these paths in the Makefile
      BOOSTLD=/opt/boost/stage/lib
      BOOSTINC=-I/opt/boost
   b) root must be set up beforehand (in path + libraries)
      ex. source thisroot.sh

2.2. for running
   a) uses shared libraries , environment variables may need to be set up
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:path-to-boost-lib:path-to-root-lib
   DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:path-to-boost-lib:path-to-root-lib
   replace path-to-boost-lib and path-to-root-lib by your paths
   source LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   source DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

3. Run make



III. USAGE

Usage: run 'browser' and open file from gui

   Here part of RD51 installation log, on 32bit SLC 4.8, by Eraldo Oliveri:
   --- start of citation ---
   We download boost_1_49_0.tar.gz from http://www.boost.org/
   (for installation http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/doc/html/bbv2/installation.html)

	> tar -xzf boost_1_49_0.tar.gz
	> cd boost_1_49_0
	> ./bootstrap.sh
	> ./bjam install

	Without prefix the default installation was in /usr/local
	We changed the Makefile replacing:
		BOOSTLD=/opt/boost/stage/lib
		BOOSTINC=-I/opt/boost
	with:
		BOOSTLD=/usr/local/lib
		BOOSTINC=-I/usr/local
      
	We add to our .bashrc the following lines:
		export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local;
		export ROOTSYS=$ROOTSYS:/usr/local/bin;
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib/root;
   --- end of citation ---
   To be tested but adding /usr/local paths may not be necessary (MB)
